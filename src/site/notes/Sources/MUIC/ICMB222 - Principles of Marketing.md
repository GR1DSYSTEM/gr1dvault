No competitors → Possibility
1. No demands

## Concept of Marketing

> [!info]+ What makes a successful brand
> - Know what are they are looking for

> - Know where they expected to buy the product
> - Use market messages to communicate the product’s value

### Human Needs
Good marketer understand customers as a person

Maslow Hierarchy of Needs
![Pasted image 20230917231922.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230917231922.png)

Poorer people mostly needs the bottom two needs of Maslow Hierarchy of Needs

> [!note] Marketing Strategy
> Target Market + Marketing Mix 

### Target Market

When presenting you can use customer persona.

#### What to ask?
- Who are buying your product?
- What are they looking for in a product?
- What are their concerns?
- Do they have any specific needs/problems that have not been addressed by the market?
- What are those unmet needs?
- How do they want to buy the product?

### Marketing Mix (4Ps Starter)
- Product
- Price
- Place
- Promotion

Additional: Personnel, Personality, Process, Packaging

## Value and Cost

> **PERCEIVED VALUE > PRICE > COST**

![Pasted image 20230919082250.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230919082250.png)

> Add value over reducing the price

### Private v. Public Hospital

> [!important] Perceived Value are personal
> Private hospital might have more monetary price but mental, time, and energy price is lower.

### Apple
- High perceived value
- High price
- Low cost

## Relationships
Strategy to create and maintain **profitable** relationships with the existing customers.

Could be more than monetary incentive.
- Social benefits: grouping, social image

My Example: Apple creating ecosystem → making it easy for their users to exchange files, contacts.

### Basic segmenting
> Do each segments want different things?

1. Demographic
2. Geographic
3. Psychographic: Lifestyle (Activity/Opinion/Interests)
4. Behavioral : Loyalty Pattern (ex-customers, loyal customers, switchers)


## Targeting

Select potential customers to sell the products.

> Watch out for market competitors

### Targeting Strategies
- Mass Marketing (Undifferentiated)
	- One size trying to fit all.
- Niche Marketing (Concentrated)
	- Try to market to only one group of potential buyers.
	- Startups/Small Company usually use this kind of marketing to start brand royalty.
- Differentiated Marketing
	- Try to market to many segment simultaneously.
	- Suited for large company
- Micromarketing
	- Customization: Birthday cake, Nike by You

## Positioning
How people think and remember about the brand → *Uniqueness offers*

### Positioning Strategy
- Convenience
- Quality (What is quality?)
- Price
	- Not Sustainable: competitors can get lower
- Experience
- Brand Image
	- Global brand use this strategy
- Innovative

Apple got 5/6 strategy?

### Positioning Map
Tool to visualize brands position.
- Can be use with survey to map the brands.

#### Need Recognition
- What kind of needs make the customers interest in the product?
- Who might be able to trigger the needs (Influencer Marketing?)
- What occasion might trigger the needs?
	- e.g. Seasons, Attire, Celebration
- How does the consumers’ need relate to their age/life stage/occupation?
- How does the Marketing Mix trigger consumers’ interest/need for the product?

#### Information Searching

Where do consumers search for the brand/product information?

- Personal Sources
- Brand-Dominated Sources
- Third Party Sources

#### Evaluation of Brands

How the consumers evaluate products and brands in their choice set
- Brand Attitude

**Look for criteria**

The customers have every details in their head, sometimes you can’t ask directly

#### Purchase Decision

Buy/Postpone/Not buy → How many → Where → How to pay (cash/cards/cash on delivery/installments)

#### Post-Purchase Behavior
Social Listening

Customer’s Satisfaction
- Satisfied
- Dissatisfied
- Unsure (Cognitive Dissonance): Confusion

This help create long-term relationship with the satisfied customers


### Think-Feel-Do Model
Customers’ decision making

## Product Strategy

![Pasted image 20231017081626.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231017081626.png)

> [!info]+ What is Product?
> Anything offered in a market for consumption that might satisfy a demand

> [!info]+ What is Service?
> A product that consists of activities, benefits, or satisfactions, no ownership

- Properties of Service
	- Intangible: Cannot be senses before purchase 
	- Inseparable: Cannot be separated from providers
	- Variable: Quality depends on people
	- Perishable: Cannot be stored for later sale or use

### Consumer Product Classifications
(There is also business product)

**Convenience Product**: snacks, water, etc.
Products that people buy frequently, immediately, with minimum comparison and effort
- Focus on distribution

**Shopping Product**: clothes, gadget, etc.
Less frequently bought, higher price than convenience product
- Focus on brand identity to convince consumers

**Specialty Product**: house, wedding ring
Higher price, high effort on purchase, time consuming
- Focus on information/specification, encourage consumer’s reviews

### IN IPAD

### Product Life Cycle (PLC)
![Pasted image 20231107082055.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231107082055.png)

> *Product’s life varies*

First mover advantage: You have to build the demand for the market but you will be recognize as a strong brand

Why exit?: In tech, innovation is fast, it is better to cannibalize the market using newer product than the same one

## Pricing Strategy
Price: The amount of money require to get the product

![Pasted image 20231107092449.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231107092449.png)
![Pasted image 20231109081634.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231109081634.png)

Ways to set price
1. Cost-based
	- Design product → Determine costs → Based on cost → Convince buyers (product’s value)
2. Value-based
	- Assess needs and perceived value → Set target price based on perceived value → Determine costs (think of margin) → Design product
3. Competitor-based
	- Understand the market structure
	![Pasted image 20231109083715.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231109083715.png)


**Break-Even Point Analysis**

$Total Fixed Cost \over Selling Price - Variable Cost$

### How to increase perceived value
- Functional: Efficiency
- Economic: Financial saving
- Social: Recognition
- Experiential: How customer experience using the product

### New Product Pricing Strategies

Price Skimming: high price to market
![Pasted image 20231109084751.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231109084751.png)
When to use
- less price sensitive buyers
- few competitors
- tech that can’t be imitated easily

Price Penetration: low price to gain market entry, encourage customer habits
When to use
- Want high *volume*

Product Line Pricing: Price different product around the same price
Psychological Pricing: Left-Digit Bias
Decoy Pricing: Introduce less attractive options (less value/price)
Segmented Pricing: Different prices for different segments
![q1036zbo3W6p61kmgbA-o.jpg](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/q1036zbo3W6p61kmgbA-o.jpg)
Captive Product Pricing: Sell refills/accessories for main product

## Distribution Strategy

> [!info] Supply Chain
> network of suppliers, company, distributors, and customers

Direct Distribution
![Pasted image 20231116084515.png](/img/user/Utilities/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231116084515.png)

Indirect Distribution: Reduce contract with individual buyers

## Marketing Communication

Example of Tools: Advertising, Sales Promotion, Content Marketing, Guerrilla Marketing

**THE AIDA MODEL**
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

Advertising: *Nonpersonal* presentation of the product/brand. Could be pair with other tools to combo.


When using influencer think about conversion Rate

=======
**Unsought Product**: insurances, supplements
Consumer doesn’t know about or knows but not thinking to buy
- Change customer beliefs
