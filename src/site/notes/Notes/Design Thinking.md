Design Thinking is a **[[User-centered Design\|User-centered]]** [[Notes/Framework\|Framework]] that help you understand users, their problems, and create solutions that address the userâ€™s problems.

The process is *non-linear* and *repeating* to refine the design.

# Five phases of Design Thinking
## Empathize

In this phase you learn about the usersâ€™
- problems
- wants
- needs
- environment
- context
- etc.

> [!important] **You are not the user.**
Donâ€™t assume about the user without gaining insight from the real user.

Research Methods
- Survey
- Interview
- Observation Session
- Conducting research on competitorsâ€™ product

The research findings are use for decision-making in later design phases.

## Define

Analyze findings from [[Notes/Design Thinking#Empathize\|emphasize phase]] to determine the most important problems and **why is it important** to set a clear goal for the design.

Provide a **clear problem statement** that the design will solve.

Value proposition (Why the user would or should use the product) could also be develop in this phase.

## Ideate

Think of as much design solutions as much as possible using technique such as brainstorming.

> The most obvious solution is not always the right one.

When brainstorming you should explore and collect all possible ideas without judging on whether it is good or bad.

### Analyzing potential solutions
Choose the best options to pursue as prototypes or return to empathize phase to narrow down the idea.

Create user flows to illustrate how the user will interact with the solution.

## Prototype

Produce an early model of a product that demonstrates the functionality.

If the design is too polished, you might not get as much feedback.

## Test

Test the prototypes with the users to redefine the prototype to easy to use and solves the userâ€™s problem.

Think about ways to include testing throughout the design process, so that youâ€™re iterating the design based on user feedback instead of other reasons.

# Examples

1. Test the concepts of the design by presenting users with a simple sketch, wireframe, or a sitemap.
2. Iterate on the design to a more detailed design on paper (low-fidelity prototype).
3. Conduct another round of user testing.
4. Iterate the design into a working, interactive model (high-fidelity prototype).
5. Conduct another round of user testing.

You might also test more than one prototype at the same time to get feedback for multiple solutions or platforms.
